Tiny Toolkit
============

This is a quick and dirty JS toolkit for HTLM element manipulation.
While it might look like a jQuery-a-like, it has nothing that
makes jQuery so powerful, so if you're already using jQuery
on a site: you have no reason to use this toolkit.

That said, it is pretty damn small compared to jQuery... So,
use your best judgement?

Note that I make no pretenses at backward compatibility.
This library is only for browsers that natively support canvas,
which rules out all the ancient browsers. I Look forward to
the days when we look back at this period and laugh at the legacy.
