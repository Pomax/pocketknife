Tiny Toolkit
============

This is a tiny JavaScript toolkit for HTLM element manipulation.
While it might look like a jQuery-a-like, it doesn't do transitions
or animation or plugins, etc, so if you're already using jQuery
on a site: you have no real reason to use this toolkit.

That said, it is pretty damn small compared to jQuery, and does 
most of the practical work it does... So, use your best judgement?

Note that I make no pretenses at backward compatibility.
This library is only for browsers that support clientBoundingRect
and classList, etc., which rules out all the ancient browsers. I
look forward to the days when we look back at this period and
laugh at the legacy support some of us were forced to do.

### window

window gets extended with several new functions:

  * extend(e) - toolkit-extend an HTML element. It stays an HTML element.
  * create(tagname) - create an extend()ed HTML element
  * template(name, substitutions) - create an extend()ed HTML element from
                                   a template file (found as name + ".tpl.html"),
                                   with {{label}} placeholders replaced by
                                   what you indicate as substitution string
                                   in the substitutions object.
  * find(selector) - returns extend()ed HTML element(s) based on CSS selector

### document

document is automatically extend()ed on load

### body

body is automatically extend()ed on DOMContentLoaded

### HTML elements

extended HTML elements have the following API. All function calls chain,
except for those indicated:

  * find(selector) - find inside the HTML's DOM fragment
  * template(name, substitutions) - fill this HTML element with a fragment from
                                    a template file (found as name + ".tpl.html"),
                                    with {{label}} placeholders replaced by
                                    what you indicate as substitution string
                                    in the substitutions object.
  * css(propname) - get the computed or declared value (resolved in that order)
                    for a specific CSS property for the element
  * css(propname, value) - set a CSS property value for the element
  * position() - returns the client's bounding rect for the element. This function
                 breaks chaining. The object returned is a clientRect with properties
                 left, right, top, bottom, width, and height.
  * classes() - returns a function object for CSS class modifications. This function
                interrupts chaining, returning an object with functions add(name),
                and remove(name). These functions resume chaining. It also contains
                the function contains(name). This function breaks chaining.
  * show(yesorno) - true = show element on page, false = hide element.
  * toggle() - flip between show() states
  * html() - get innerHTML
  * html(htmltext) set innerHTML
  * parent() - get element's extend()ed parentNode
  * add(child) - add one or more children to this element (more arguments = more children. null permitted)
  * remove() - remove this element from its parent. This function, obviously, breaks chaining.
  * remove(child) - remove child from this element
  * remove(int) - remove child number <int> from this element
  * clear() - remove all children for this element (does the same as .html(""), really)
  * get(attrname) - get attribute value for this element
  * set(attrname, value) - set an attribute value for this element
  * listenOnce(eventName, function) - let element listen to a specific event
                                      but unregister as listener after it triggers.
                                      You may add an optional third "useCapture" arg,
                                      but if you don't know what that means, don't.
  * listen(eventName, function) - make element a listener for the specified event.


### set API

When find(selector) matches multiple elements, you get a set instead of a single
element. Consider this a normal JavaScript array, with a few more functions,
because that's literally what it is. Sets have a smaller API than elements, since
functions that get values for single elements don't make sense for sets. These
functions chain, unless otherwise indicated:

  * css(propname, value) - set CSS property value for all elements in the set.
  * show(yesorno) - show (or not) all elements
  * toggle() - toggle all elements
  * remove() - remove all elements from their parents. This function, obviously, does not chain.
  * listen(eventName, function) - make all elements listeners for the specified event
  * listenOnce(eventName, function) - idem ditto, but only once.
  * classes() - passthrough, use as .classes().add(name) and .classes().remove(name).
  * foreach(function) - call function once for each element, passing the element as parameter. 


### templates

Tiny toolkit can also load template files, as long as they're called [something].tpl.html,
which can be any HTML fragment, as long as it doesn't have script elements (for now).
Templates are loaded using the template function:

  * element.template("name", {name: value, name2: value2: ...});

This will load "name.tpl.html", with instances of {{name}} replaced with value,
{{name2} with value2, etc. Conditional blocks use the "Mustache" #/ syntax:

  * {{#name}}this will show up{{/name}} but {{#nopenope}} This won't{{/nopenope}}.


Extensions
----------

You can write exensions for the toolkit, have a look at how
the extension for input type="range" handles things. The main
trick is to hook into the Toolkit.update() function - the rest
is up to you.

Speaking of that extension:

### tiny-toolkit-input-type-range

The input type="range" extension adds HTML5 sliders to browsers
that don't support them, but do support the toolkit. They get
replaced by a a "div" as rail, with all the input attribtues,
and a "span" slide head element.

The only JavaScript event offered is onchange, in the div
(automatically copied from the input element if it was defined).

The extension effects a full replacement sweep on DOMContentLoaded,
and shims Toolkit so that create("input") will lead to a replacement
when input.set("type","range") is called. It also extends the
Toolkit.update() function so that any stray <input type="range">
elements are converted when update is called.

Particularly IE9 seems to need an extra Toolkit.update() when
injecting input type="range" elements with this extension in place.
