    <h1>Real site and documentation still forthcoming!</h1>

    <p>So the most important reason this page exists is
    to act as online "does tiny-toolkit pass the unit tests
    in your browser?" live github site. (<a href="test.html">Find
    out here</a>, btw. Source repo <a href="http://github.com/pomax/tiny-toolkit/tree/gh-pages">here</a>)</p>

    <p>With that said...</p>

    <h2>Tiny Toolkit</h2>

    <p>Tiny toolkit is a small (I'm trying to keep it near 10kb,
    it's a little over atm, but at least it minifies to 5kb)
    library that expands the JS API for HTML elements, element
    creation, and element query selecting. Think of it as a
    pocket knife for DOM stuff, contrasted to jQuery's
    squadron of helicopter gunships.</p>

    <p>One thing it does quite well is not care about whether your
    selector found zero, one, or multiple results. The API
    will be the same, so none of that crazy $("p")[0] nonsense:
    just use find("p") and if there's only one result, that
    will be a normal HTML element. With extended API. If there's
    more, it'll be an array. With the same extended API.</p>

    <p>Most functions chain, meaning you can do things like:</p>

    <pre>
        document.body.add(
          create("div", {id: "temp"}, "This is a temp div")
          .show(false)
        ).find("#temp")
         .parent()
         .get(0)
         .remove()
    </pre>

    <p>(yes, that's a very elaborate way to effect a net result
    of no change - make div, add div, make div invisible, find
    div in body, get div's parent, which is body, get body's
    first child, which is div, then tell that to remove itself)</p>

    <p>Note that tiny toolkit "installs" itself into the DOM API.
    As such, it's not so much a library as bolt-on JS API
    extension. It changes the Array and HTMLElement prototypes,
    and this may break things. If you don't like that, don't
    use this. Frankly, the Array and HTMLElement JS APIs are
    long overdue for an update, and it was starting to annoy
    me to no end. So this fixed that for me. Hopefully it
    fixes things for you too =)</p>

    <p>There's a battery of tests for the API, for both HTMLElement
    and Array, and so far all tests pass on Chrome, Firefox,
    Opera, Safari and IE. If you're doing something and you
    run into a bug, file an issue and I can add a test for it,
    then fix it (in that order).</p>
